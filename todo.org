* TODO README.md notes
** `No API keys required.` as a feature
** `save tokens by taking work from your agent to your code`
** compare to https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec
*** fsms instead of plain texts
*** "better" Markdown
** you can deliver instructions and operations for your package with your package
** every error is accompanied with the ways to fix it
** goals:
*** maximum determinism
*** maximum introspection
*** maximum quality
*** LLMs must do only the work they can do better than code
*** not a goal: optimizing tokens (however, we do this when we can)
*** not a goal: optimizing speed (however, we do this when we can)
** How Donna help agents to do their work better
*** Validation of artifacts
*** Every error is accompanied with the explanation and list of ways to fix it
*** Do algorithmic operations without need for LLMs to think about them
*** Controls meta flow of work, so agent should not think about it
** Since the donna is developed with donna, Donna's `.donna` directory is a great example of how to structure donna workspaces and how to work with it in general.
** this is also an experiment on agent-friendly cli tools
** known problems
*** lack of reporting — when a long chain of automated operations is performed, there is no convenient report/logging of what donna doing
*** agent tools (like codes) does not properly report what is happening
**** action requests as a verbose approach vs run_script as a silent approach
** You can distribute your specs as a separate package or within your own lib and you don't need dependency on donna.
** list of python packages that support donna
*** changy
*** brigid
*** feeds fun
** I don't beliew in manual orchestrators, in the future, agents will be capable of orchestrating their work => donna is developed as a helpfull tool, not as a full-fledged orchestrator.
** you can redefine behavior of any primitives: directive, operation, even artifacts (including workflows)
** like OpenSpec, but more hardcore and much more powerful (?).
*** implement OpenSpec workflows as an example?
** most of other tools concentrate on particular flow. With donna you can implement your own flow
** All you need is action-request operation, but there are more
** describe label `proposal`
** mark some proposals with `good first issue`
** meta-workflows must select child workflows dynamically.
** create workflow once and you agent will always behave the same way.
* TODO Specification improvements:
** do we need to explicitly reference `session.specification.work_scope.md` if its name has already specified in donna.specifications.planning?
** {{ edit(specification) }} directive?
** {{ run(workflow) }} directive?
* TODO Workflows polishing
** tune wording of workflows (what to write before goto)
** completed session keeps work_scope.md and work_scope_execution.md artifacts, we must add cleanup on the first step of planing.
** on initialization donna should create some default workflows based on the project configs (grooming, for example)
* TODO Massive spellcheck
* TODO Donna-agents integration
** Install donna as a skill
** Install donna as a tool
** slash commands for donna
** installing donna cli via online instruction for agents
** specify usage modes somewhere:
*** easy mode — one of possible skills to use
*** hard mode — forse agent to work via donna
* TODO the developer must choose wether to start new session
* TODO improve donna:engine:specs:research
* TODO review donna:* docs
* TODO change rendering of titles in human output mode?
* TODO update config logic to use relative paths for home, project and session
