# FSM Driven Development

Your agent will generate [state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) while executing state machines that are generated by state machines.

## What is Donna?

Donna is a CLI tool that helps coding agents like Codex to behave deterministically and focus on the perfomed work.

It is designed to invert control flow: instead of agent deciding what to do and in which order, Donna dictates what should be done on each step of work, so the agent can focus on the actual piece of work.

However, Donna is not an orchestrator, it is a tool to be used by agent, so, it can be used with any agent and does not require API keys or any other credentials. You may look at a donna like on the work diary or personal secretary for your agent.

The core idea:

- **Most high-level work are more algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**
- **Most low-level workf are less algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**

For example, it may be non-trivial to fix a particular unit test, but the overall process of polishing the codebase is quite linear:

1. Ensure all tests pass.
2. Ensure the code is formatted correctly.
3. Ensure there are no linting errors.
4. Go to the step 1 if you changed something in the process.
5. Finish.

Coding agents show greate results on each separate step of the process, however they often struggle to manage meta-loops in deterministic maner — they forget steps, misinterpret results, use wrong ways to run tools, etc.

So, Donna executes such loops for the agents and therefore saves time, context and tokens simultaneously increasing the overall quality of work.

## Features

- **Deterministic workflows** — fixed & validated control flows.
- **Saves context, tokens and time** — agents do not need to think when thinking is not required.
- **Readable artifacts** — all workflows and specifications are pure Markdown files with some [Jinja2](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) templating.
- **Artifact management** — non-fuzzy navigation and smart agent-focused rendering of specs.
- **Artifact distribution** — install your docs/workflows/skills as (with) your Python package.
- **Agent-centric behavior** with clear instructions, suggestions on fixing mistakes.
- **Extensible architecture** — implement your own operations, validators, renderers; add support for new artifact formats and storages (worlds).
- **Batteries included** — Donna goes with a set of pre-defined workflows, so you can start using it right away.

## Example

Donna is developed via Donna itself. So, you can find real life examples of workflows and specifications in the [.donna/project](./.donna/project) folder of this repository.

The example below is a simplified version of the polishing workflow that formats code, runs linters and fixes found problems untill all checks pass. It uses the single operaton type `donna.lib.request_action` to ask the agent to perform specific instructions.

```
                                no issues
[ run_black ] ──▶ [ run_mypy ] ───────────▶ [ finish ]
      ▲                │
      │  issues fixed  │
      └────────────────┘
```

# Polishing Workflow

```toml donna
kind = "donna.lib.workflow"
start_operation_id = "run_black"
```

Initiate operations to polish and refine the codebase: …

## Run Black

```toml donna
id = "run_black"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

1. Run `black .` to format the codebase.
2. `{{ goto("run_mypy") }}`

## Run Mypy

```toml donna
id = "run_mypy"
kind = "donna.lib.request_action"
```

1. Run `mypy .` to check the codebase for type annotation issues.
2. If there are issues found that you can fix, fix them.
3. Ask developer to fix any remaining issues manually.
4. If you made changes `{{ goto("run_black") }}`.
5. If no issues are found `{{ goto("finish") }}`.

## Finish

```toml donna
id = "finish"
kind = "donna.lib.finish"
```

Polishing is complete.

</details>

What you may notice:

1. The workflow has a loop.
2. The workflow is a Markdown file.
3. Each h1 and h2 section has a config block which is a TOML in code fences with `donna` marker. Those configs are invisible to the agent, but Donna uses them to understand the artifact structure.
4. The workflow has two `donna.lib.request_action` operations (`run_black`, `run_mypy`) and one `donna.lib.finish` (`finish`).
5. Transitions between operations are defined via `{{ goto("operation_id") }}` Jinja2 calls in the body of operations.
6. `donna.lib.request_action` is an operation that tells Donna to display instructions to the agent and wait for the agent to complete them. That allows agent to focus on short precise intructions, perform them and push workflow forward.
7. `kind` attributes of sections are valid Python import paths, so you can easily extend Donna with your own logic.

Directives, like `{{ goto("operation_id") }}`, render itself depending on the context:

- For the agent they render an exect CLI command to run, such as `donna -p llm sessions action-request-completed <action-request-id> 'artifact_id:operation_id'`.
- For Donna they render a specific marker, that can be extracted and used to analyze an artifact. For example, Donna uses `goto` directives to build a FSM model of the workflow and validate it before running: does each operation exist, is there a way to finish the workflow, are there unreachable operations, etc.

You can find a more complex implementaion of the same workflow in the [polish.md](./.donna/project/work/polish.md) file. It demonstrates other Donna operations such as running the scripts directly, branching, etc.

## Installation

1. Install `donna` package.

```bash
pip install donna

cd <your-project-root>
donna -p human workspaces init
```

Donna will create a `.donna/` folder in your project root with a default configuration in `.donna/config.toml`.

2. Add short instruction into your `AGENT.md` file.

```markdown
**Use `donna` tool to work on this project.**

**ALWAYS** run `donna -p llm artifacts view '*:intro'` when you start working on the projct. It **MUST** be a one time operation. Do not repeat it unless you forget how to use the tool.
```

## Usage

**Donna is a CLI tool for agents.** You rarery need to use it directly.

Use `donna --help` if you need a quick reference.

You find detailed documentation in the agent instructions — they are readable and always accurate:

- [Intro](./donna/artifacts/intro.md) — introduction to Donna tool.
- [Full CLI specification](./donna/artifacts/usage/cli.md) — full list of commands and how to use them.
- [Artifacts](./donna/artifacts/usage/artifacts.md) — what is Donna artifact and how to use them.
- [Worlds](./donna/artifacts/usage/worlds.md) — how Donna discovers and manages its artifacts.

The documentation below covers aspects that are important for Humans and partially duplicates the agent instructions.

## Batteries Included

Donna comes with a set of pre-defined workflows and specifications that empower agents to work in a Donna way.

However, **I encourage you to experiment and implement your own workflows**.

By default, Donna uses the next approach to introduce changes in your project:

1. Prepare a Request for Comments (RFC) document that describes the required changes.
2. Create a workflow that implements the changes described in the RFC.
3. Execute new workflow.

Additionaly, Donna will:

- choose fast or slow route depending on the complexity of the changes required;
- find and run polishing workflow to ensure the codebase is in a good state after the changes;
- find and run workflow to update your changelog.

Points of interests:

- [donna:rfc:specs:request_for_change](./donna/artifacts/rfc/specs/request_for_change.md) — specification of the RFC document.
- [donna:rfc:work:create](./donna/artifacts/rfc/work/create.md) — workflow to create a RFC document.
- [donna:rfc:work:plan](./donna/artifacts/rfc/work/plan.md) — workflow to plan work on a RFC — creates a new workflow.
- [donna:rfc:work:do](./donna/artifacts/rfc/work/do.md) — meta workflow to automate the whole way from a developer request to a changelog update.

## Artifacts and Worlds

- Artifacts is something that Donna owns. Currently it is a Markdown files with workflows and specifications.
- World is a storage for artifacts. Currently, Donna supports two types of worlds:
    - `donna.lib.worlds.filesystem` — a folder on the filesystem.
    - `donna.lib.worlds.python` — a Python package.

**Please, tell if you need other world types.** It looks interesting to have `http`, `s3`, `git`, `sql` worlds.

By default, Donna uses the next worlds:

- `donna` — artifacts provided by Donna itself;
- `home` — user-level donna artifacts in `<HOME>/.donna/` folder;
- `project` — project-level donna artifacts in `<project-root>/.donna/project/` folder;
- `session` — session-level donna artifacts in `<project-root>/.donna/session/` folder.

Besides that, there is `<project-root>/.donna/tmp` folder used to store temporary files.

World can be readonly. By default, writable worlds are `session` (when agent to regular work) and `project` (when agent needs to permanently save resulted artifacts).

Agents are not allowed to edit artifacts directly, because artifacts consistency is important. Instead they follow the next algorithm:

- Featch an artifact with the command `donna -p llm artifacts fetch ...` into the temporary file.
- Edit the temporary file.
- Upload an artifact with the command `donna -p llm artifacts upload ...`.

On upload Donna validates the artifact and accept it only when there are no errors. For example, Donna will not accept a broken FSM as a workflow.

### Artifacts Discovery

Artifact is identified by its id: `<world>:<colon-spearated-path>`, for example, `donna:usage:cli`.

You and agents can `list` artifacts and `view` them.

- `donna -p llm artifacts list <pattern>` — shows a short description from its h1 section.
- `donna -p llm artifacts view <pattern>` — shows the full content of the artifact with proper rendering.

Both commands accept both precise artifact ids and glob patterns. Patterns allow using:

- `*` to replace a single path segment;
- `**` to replace multiple path segments.

Examples:

- `*:artifact:name` — matches all artifacts named `artifact:name` in all worlds.
- `world:*:name` — matches all artifacts with id `something:name` in the `world` world.
- `**:name` — matches all artifacts with id ending with `:name` in all worlds.
- `world:**` — matches all artifacts in the `world` world.
- `world:**:name` — matches all artifacts with id ending with `:name` in the `world` world.

Both commands also accept `--tag <tag>` option to filter artifacts by their tags.

Currently Donna supports two artifact types:

- `workflow` — workflow artifact — is set automatically by Donna.
- `specification` — specification artifact — is set automatically by Donna.

So, you can find all workflows with the command `donna -p llm artifacts list '**' --tag workflow`.

## Sessions

`session` world contains the current state of work performed by Donna: all documents and workflows that are created during work and should not be stored permanently in the project.

The developer is responsible for staring/reseting sessions with commands from `donna -p human sessions` group.

- On session start Donna removes everything from the previous session and creates a fresh `session` world.
- On session reset donna resets the state of the current session (tasks, action requests, etc.), but keeps artifacts.

Agent is encoraged to not manage sessions directly, because it doen't have enough context to decide when session artifacts may be safely removed.

## Workflows

Workflows are [state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), they defined in Markdown files by an h1 section with `donna.lib.workflow` kind and multiple h2 sections that implement operations.

Donna tracks dependencies between operations and validates the workflow before running it. So, if you or agent do something wrong, you'll get a clear error message from Donna.

You can run workflow as `donna -p llm sessions run <artifact-id>`.

To exectute a workflow, Donna uses a simplified virtual machine (VM) that manages the current state of all executed workflows in the current session.

<details>
<summary><strong>What you may want to know about workflows implementation</strong></summary>
- `.donna/session/state.json` file contains the current state of all running workflows in the current session.
- Each workflow executes in the context of its own task which is distant analog of a call stack frame. So, we may look at workflows as a functions.
- Of course, workflows may call other workflows as subroutines. At the moment only last executed workflow is active.
- Task has a context that is accessible by operations. There are an issue [command to read/write task context](https://github.com/Tiendil/donna/issues/47) to allow agents and humans to edit task context.
- The internal VM operates in terms of work units. An operation can produce multiple work units, so it should be possible different interesting scenarios, however, I don't tested them yet.
</details>

### Operations

You can find detailed docs of built-in operations in the [artifacts documentation](./donna/artifacts/usage/operations.md).

Here is a short list of them:

- `donna.lib.request_action` — request the agent to perform specific instructions.
- `donna.lib.run_script` — run a script from the environment Donna is running in. Choose the next operation based on the return code. Can store `stdout` and `stderr` in the task context.
- `donna.lib.output` — output a cell with specific content and immediately goes to the next operation.
- `donna.lib.finish` — finish the workflow. This operation always MUST be present in the workflow and MUST end all possible execution paths.

### Error handling

Donna can detect errors (in artifacts, in execution, etc). If the error can be fixed by the agent or the developer, Donna will output a detailed error description with a list of ways to fix it.

Example:

```bash
$ donna -p llm sessions run project:work:polish

kind=artifact_validation_error
media_type=text/markdown
artifact_id=project:work:polish
error_code=donna.artifacts.section_not_found
section_id=run_autoflake_scriptx

Error in artifact 'project:work:polish', section 'run_autoflake_scriptx': Section `run_autoflake_scriptx` is not available in artifact `project:work:polish`.

Ways to fix:

- Check the section id for typos.
- Ensure the section exists in the artifact
```

### Generating workflows

The power of Donna comes from the ability of to create workflows on the fly and execute them immediately. So, you can create a workflow that creates a workflow that creates a workflow that does something useful :)

You can even modify the workflow while it is running, the only requirement is to not lose the ids of the currently executing/waiting operations.

The simplest example of such generation is currently used as a primary way for Donna to work on the current project:

1. Create a document with a changes description.
2. Generate a workflow to implement the changes described in the document.
3. Execute the generated workflow.

### Discovering workflow

If you want to run a child workflow from an operation, you can just tell Donna something like `Run the workflow project:work:my-cool-workflow` and Donna will find it and run.

However, it is not very agile. Instead I suggest you to describe changes you want to make and let the agent find most suitable workflow for the them. In that case you'll be able to define customized workflows for specific types of changes and let the agent choose the best one for the current situation.

For example, you can have two workflows `project:work:write-backend-test` and `project:work:write-frontend-test` and your operation can just say `Run the workflow that can help to write a test for the current change` and the agent will choose the most suitable workflow based on the current context and the workflow descriptions.
