Your agent will generate state machines while executing state machines that are generated by state machines.

## What is Donna?

Donna is a CLI tool that helps coding agents like Codex to behave deterministically and focus on the perfomed work.

It is designed to invert control flow: instead of agent deciding what to do and in which order, Donna dictates what should be done on each step of work, so the agent can focus on the actual piece of work.

However, Donna is not an orchestrator, it is a tool to be used by agent, so, it can be used with any agent and does not require API keys or any other credentials. You may look at a donna like on the work diary or personal secretary for your agent.

The core idea:

- **Most high-level work are more algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**
- **Most low-level workf are less algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**

For example, it may be non-trivial to fix a particular unit test, but the overall process of polishing the codebase is quite linear:

1. Ensure all tests pass.
2. Ensure the code is formatted correctly.
3. Ensure there are no linting errors.
4. Go to the step 1 if you changed something in the process.
5. Finish.

Coding agents show greate results on each separate step of the process, however they often struggle to manage meta-loops in deterministic maner — they forget steps, misinterpret results, use wrong ways to run tools, etc.

So, Donna executes such loops for the agents and therefore saves time, context and tokens simultaneously increasing the overall quality of work.

## Features

- **Deterministic workflows** — fixed & validated control flows.
- **Saves context, tokens and time** — agents do not need to think when thinking is not required.
- **Artifact management** — non-fuzzy navigation and smart agent-focused rendering of specs.
- **Artifact distribution** — install your docs/workflows/skills as Python packages.
- **Agent-centric behavior** with clear instructions, suggestions on fixing mistakes.

## Installation

1. Install `donna` package.

```bash
pip install donna

cd <your-project-root>
donna -p human workspaces init
```

2. Add short instruction into your `AGENT.md` file.

```markdown
**Use `donna` tool to work on this project.**

**ALWAYS** run `donna -p llm artifacts view '*:intro'` when you start working on the projct. It **MUST** be a one time operation. Do not repeat it unless you forget how to use the tool.
```

## Usage

**Donna is a CLI tool for agents.** You rarery need to use it directly, however, there are some concepts you should be aware of.

Use `donna --help` if you need a quick reference.

Detailed instructions can be found in specifications for agents:

- [Full CLI specification](./donna/artifacts/usage/cli.md) — full list of commands and how to use them.
- [Artifacts](./donna/artifacts/usage/artifacts.md) — what is Donna artifact and how to use them.
- [Worlds](./donna/artifacts/usage/worlds.md) — how Donna discovers and manages its artifacts.



## Notes

- FSM term is too nurrow, soon, with a few fixes, Donna may become a Turing complete system for agent control. "FSM Driven Development" sounds funnier than "Turing Complete System Driven Development" :)
