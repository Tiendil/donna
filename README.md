Your agent will generate state machines while executing state machines that are generated by state machines.

## What is Donna?

Donna is a CLI tool that helps coding agents like Codex to behave deterministically and focus on the perfomed work.

It is designed to invert control flow: instead of agent deciding what to do and in which order, Donna dictates what should be done on each step of work, so the agent can focus on the actual piece of work.

However, Donna is not an orchestrator, it is a tool to be used by agent, so, it can be used with any agent and does not require API keys or any other credentials. You may look at a donna like on the work diary or personal secretary for your agent.

The core idea:

- **Most high-level work are more algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**
- **Most low-level workf are less algorithmic than it may seem at first glance.**

For example, it may be non-trivial to fix a particular unit test, but the overall process of polishing the codebase is quite linear:

1. Ensure all tests pass.
2. Ensure the code is formatted correctly.
3. Ensure there are no linting errors.
4. Go to the step 1 if you changed something in the process.
5. Finish.

Coding agents show greate results on each separate step of the process, however they often struggle to manage meta-loops in deterministic maner — they forget steps, misinterpret results, use wrong ways to run tools, etc.

So, Donna executes such loops for the agents and therefore saves time, context and tokens simultaneously increasing the overall quality of work.

## Features

- **Deterministic workflows** — fixed & validated control flow.
- **Saves context, tokens and time** — agents do not need to think when thinking is not required.
- **Artifact management** — non-fuzzy navigation and smart agent-focused rendering.
- **Artifact distribution** — install your docs/workflows/skills as Python packages.
- **Agent-centric behavior** with clear instructions, suggestions on fixing mistakes.

Deterministic behavior, state machines, artifact management, and meta programming for your coding agent


## State Machines for your AI Agents

`Donna` is a CLI tool that helps manage the work of AI agents like Codex.

It is designed to to invert control flow: instead of agents deciding what to do next, the `donna` tells agents what to do next by following predefined workflows.

The core idea is that most of high-level workflows are more algorithmic than it may seem at first glance. For example, it may be difficult to fix a particular type issue in the codebase, but the overall process of polishing the codebase is quite linear:

1. Ensure all tests pass.
2. Ensure the code is formatted correctly.
3. Ensure there are no linting errors.
4. Go to the step 1 if you changed something in the process.
5. Finish.

We may need coding agents on the each step of the process, but there no reason for agents to manage the whole grooming loop by themselves — it take longer time, spends tokens and may lead to confusion of agents.

## Notes

- FSM term is too nurrow, soon, with a few fixes, Donna may become a Turing complete system for agent control. "FSM Driven Development" sounds funnier than "Turing Complete System Driven Development" :)
