# Instructions for the AI Agents

This document provides instructions and guidelines for the AI agents working on this project.

Every agent MUST follow the rules and guidelines outlined in this document when performing their work.

## First actions

**You need the Donna tool to work on this project.**

Since this is the repository that contains the Donna project itself, you have direct access to the Donna CLI tool via `./bin/donna.sh` script.

I.e. you develop Donna using Donna.

**ALWAYS** perform the next steps when you start working.

1. Read the specification of how to use Donna: `./bin/donna.sh -p llm artifacts view donna:usage:cli`.
2. Read the inroduction to the Donna project: `./bin/donna.sh -p llm artifacts view project:intro`.
