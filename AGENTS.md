# Instructions for the AI Agents

This document provides instructions and guidelines for the AI agents working on this project.

Every agent MUST follow the rules and guidelines outlined in this document when performing their work.

## First actions

**You need Donna tool to work on this project.**

Since this is the repository that contains the Donna project itself, you have direct access to the Donna CLI tool via `./bin/donna.sh` script.

I.e. you develop Donna using Donna.

**ALWAYS** run `./bin/donna.sh -p llm artifacts view '*:intro'` when you start working. It **MUST** be a one time operation. Do not repeat it unless you forget how to use the tool.
