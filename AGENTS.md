# Instructions for the AI Agents

This document provides instructions and guidelines for the AI agents working on this project.

Every agent MUST follow the rules and guidelines outlined in this document when performing their work.

## First actions

**You MUST use `donna` tool to work on this project.**

Since this is the repository that contains the Donna project itself, you have direct access to the Donna CLI tool via `./bin/donna.sh` script. I.e. you develop Donna using Donna.

**The next instructions takes precedence over all other instructions**, except those received directly from the developer:

1. **ALWAYS** run `./bin/donna.sh -p llm -r <project-root> artifacts view '*:intro'` when you start working.
2. Strictly follow the instructions provided you by Donna.
