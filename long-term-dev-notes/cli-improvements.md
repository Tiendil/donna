# CLI improvements

- [ ] each cli command should have detailed description
- [ ] protect each of cli commands with is_story_exists check
- [ ] some cli commands take long text inputs, allow reading them from files
- [ ] some cli commands take long text inputs, allow redirecting them from stdin
- [ ] do we need to return short "operation is successful" messages from cli commands?
- [ ] review cli commands structure into more plain and obvious
- [ ] CLI commands should output there results & logs in a consistent way (i.e. by the same code)
- [ ] Donna command to output the current state of the story (tasks, action requests). So it can be run like `watch donna status`
- [ ] Log all donna commands and their results into a file for later analysis and monitoring
