# Rules for the AI Agents

This document extends `AGENTS.md`. Agents MUST follow both documents when working on the project.

## General

- Read `AGENTS.md` and this file before starting work on any story.
- If instructions conflict, ask for clarification; otherwise treat rules here as complementary details.
- Use tools documented in `.agents/TOOLS.md` and in `~/.my-local-agents/TOOLS.md`; avoid installing new host tools unless explicitly allowed.

## Commits

- Make commits only when the developer explicitly asks you to make commits without further approval.
- If the developer allows, make commits after completing any meaningful chunk of work.
- Use the format `agent-story-<story-id>-<story-slug>: <short description>` for commit messages.
- Good places to commit:
  - After confirming that introduced changes work correctly.
  - After completing the whole story.
